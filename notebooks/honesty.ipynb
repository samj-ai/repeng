        "\n",
        "- Set the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.\n",
        "- Avoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.\n",
        "- For mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n",
        "- When evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.\n",
        "- Additionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting \"< think >\\n\\n< /think >\") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model's performance. To ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with \"< think >\\n\" at the beginning of every output."
